Capstone Project:

Steps :
	1. Choose the Dataset:
		a. Missing Values Present
		b. Dataset should be combination of numeric and categorical variables.
		c. Row Count >=1000 to 100000
		d. Column Count >=10 and <=1000.
		e. Should be based on some trending topic.
		
	2. Study the Data.
		a. Understand the meaning and relevance of each column in the data set.
		b. Identify irrelavent columns like Serial No., ID# which can be dropped during preprocessing.
	
	3. Start Preprocessing:
		a. You can choose to run Pandas Preprofiling Report.
		b. Perform Preprocessing:
			i) Data Cleaning: Imputing Missing Values, Check and replace for NAN values, Remove Duplicates ( Refer to High Cardinality in Pandas Preprofiling report), Check and drop High Correlated Columns.
		c. Run Pandas Postprofiling Report.
	
	4. EDA:
		a. Outlier Detection
		b. Converting Categorical to Numeric Data. ( One Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).
		c. Normalization ( Standard Scalar, Min Max Scalar e.t.c).
		d. Data Visualization : Univariate, Bi Variate and Multivariate Analysis using Python Libraries.
		e.Autocorelation should be absent in the data.
	
	5. Split the Data into Training and Test Set. ( test_size=0.3 / 0.2). Go for test_size=0.3 if the row_count of the dataset is <1000.
	
	6. Implement the Machine Learning Algorithm:
		a. Choosing the best algorithm for the data. Refer to the article following the below link: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-choose-the-right-machine-learning-algorithm-for-your-application-1e36c32400b9
		
		b. LazyPredict:
		c. Refer the the FF_classification.ipynb file shared by me.
	
	8. Perform Model Evaluation.
		a. If Model performance is per expectation : Proceed with next step.
		b. If Model performance is not per expectation: Repeat step 6 with hypertuning the parameters or using a different model.
	
	9. Provide Colclusion on the Machine Learning Model that is build.
	
Additional Tips: 
 * Always maintain a content index.
 * Always follow the heading pattern. 
 * Always use Text/Markdown before a code cell to explain what is being attempted to be done.
 * Always use Texrt/Markdown column to explain the observation/output from the code cell.
 * Provide Actionable Insigths after performing the EDA.
 * In Conclusion, mention the pros and cons of each algorithm used.
